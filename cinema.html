      <h3>Cinema: My Greatest Passion</h3>
      <p>Cinema is the last form of art to express itself. Since the Lumiere Brothers laid the foundations of cinema, cinema has renewed itself and continues to do so. This branch, which is divided into species within itself, is categorized according to "genre". Cinema with subgenres such as horror, comedy, erotic, drama; becomes striking with the final touch of the directors. Artists, who we call auteur directors, , and their signatures to films with various motifs or techniques specific to them.</p>
      <p>Everything is included, from Woody Allen's city introductions to Kubrick's setting of centering and depth of the scene. The evaluation of the elements added to the film by the directors from the articles about cinema on this site; we will cover everything from what to pay attention to while watching a movie, to what mistakes the in-depth examinations made during movie readings actually lead us to.
</p>
      <p>Cinema's beauty is not only limited with these factors.  Telling a story, in its own narrative. Its freedom that gives anyone to tell their story in their own way which is an incredible opportunity. In our Directing class, same scripts were given to us, and we were the ones who shoot. After we shot, we had a chance to see all of them and the result was so odd. Every one of them was really different. It was like another script. However, main characters and the event were the same. Like this little example, every little part of the cinema works for whole. </p>
