      <h3>My Passion For Cinema, Literature and Music</h3>
      <p>Everybody has some interests. It could be fashion, it could be art or it could be football. </p>
      <p>My passion has started as cinema, however while cinema is becoming a thing; I've figured that there are other elements that create cinema in a specific way.</p>
      <p>Cinema feeds on litearature. For example, A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick's famous movie was once a novel. Literature's steps on writing and cinema's steps on scripts are nearly same. A hero, then his journey basically. </p>
      <p>Also without music, a diagetic world cannot be created. Remember Fight Club, at the ending scene, Where is My Mind plays and it changes its effect suddenly more are more. </p>
      <p>Getting into cinema made me question all of these elements. I felt like I needed a knowledge in all of these stuff. Therefore, while understanding literature or music; their world were something else. Yes, there are some common parts but defining them only as cinema's elements would be a total contempt.</p>
